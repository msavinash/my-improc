# Mymage (Python Image Processing library)
This an effort to mimic simple functions of the celebrated OpenCV library with a slightly different implementation of functions.
Python modules used:  Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Mpl_toolkits

Functions implemented:
1. split
2. InRange
4. rescale
5. grayscale (with many levels)
6. blur
7. sharpen
8. erosion
9. dilation
10. contrast
11. brightness
12. edge_detect

  And a few more.
Check it out to see the (nearly correct) implementation of OpenCV functions.
